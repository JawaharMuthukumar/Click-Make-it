## Problem Statement

Many home cooks, students, singles, and busy families regularly face the same challenge: they have a limited and often random assortment of ingredients at home, yet struggle to decide what meal they can make from them. This problem causes stress, frustration, and food waste, and it becomes a major barrier for those who want to cook authentic Indian food but feel they lack the right ingredients or expertise.

## Expanded Problem Details

### Decision Paralysis
After opening the fridge or pantry, users see assorted vegetables, leftovers, or staples but feel overwhelmed by too many choices or confused about what combinations will actually create a meal. As a result, they either default to repetitive, dull meals or give up and order takeout, increasing costs and reducing dietary variety.​

### Time Crunched Situations
Most users do not want to spend time researching online for recipes or solutions, especially after work. They need instant answers and clear, simple options—something most recipe apps or cookbooks don’t provide because they require starting from the end (the recipe), not the beginning (the ingredients the user has).​

### Ingredient Waste
Food is wasted because users can’t see how to combine what’s available. Fresh produce spoils, and partial ingredients (half a can, odd spices) remain unused because it’s too much trouble to search for fits.​

### Lack of Culinary Confidence
Non-experts (and even moderate cooks) often doubt their own ability to improvise meals, especially with a cuisine as nuanced as Indian food. They’re afraid that using non-traditional ingredients will lead to poor-tasting results, causing anxiety and reluctance to try.​

### Mismatch with User Intent
Existing solutions ask users to input a recipe name or desired dish—but the real, frequent problem is: “What can I make, right now, with these exact items at home?” Recipe search requires knowing WHAT you want before you search. The user’s actual problem is that they don’t know.​

## Quantifiable Impact

- Wasted food (estimated at billions in household waste globally per year)​
- Increased stress and “what’s for dinner?” anxiety
- Less nutrition and dietary diversity, especially a barrier to trying new cuisines.
- Frustration with existing kitchen/food apps that don’t start with “what you have”

## Why Is This Problem Underserved?

- Most recipe solutions start with the name or cuisine, not the ingredient inventory.​
- Indian cooking is often perceived as complex or requiring special, hard-to-find ingredients. There's a lack of tools that empower users to create authentic Indian flavors with everyday, non-traditional ingredients they already have.
- Users want near-instant, “no-brainer” options presented in a simple, guided format.
